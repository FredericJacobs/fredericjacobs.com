    <p>It&rsquo;s easy to be lazy these days and give up on the decentralized property of the Internet. You can find pretty much everything that requires more than a minute to set up &ldquo;as a service&rdquo;. I hadn&rsquo;t self-hosted my blog for years. What prompted me to go back to self-hosting from Medium?</p>

<p>Tracking of readers was a concern but didn&rsquo;t bothered me enough to make the effort of self-hosting. I was increasingly frustrated about not having control over the layout of my posts, not being able to embed code without having to embed a GitHub Gist. And since Medium isn&rsquo;t monetized yet, I had some uncertainties about the future of the platform.</p>

<p>Welcome to this new home.</p>

<p>The pleasure of self-hosting my blog also comes with my renewed love for RSS. You can <a href="https://www.fredericjacobs.com/blog/feed.xml">subscribe</a> to get all the blog posts, without the noise of having to <a href="https://twitter.com/FredericJacobs">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Note: Previous <a href="https://medium.com/@FredericJacobs">blog posts</a> will stay on Medium.</p>
